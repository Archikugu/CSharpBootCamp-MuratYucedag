  - Accessed the length of an array and sorted its elements using `Array.Sort()`.
  - Reversed the order of elements in an array with `Array.Reverse()`.
  - Utilized `Array.IndexOf()` to find the index of a specific element and the `Max()` and `Min()` methods to identify the largest and smallest elements.

- **User Input**:
  - Collected user-defined country names into an array and displayed them.
  - Calculated the sum of elements in a predefined array.

- **Separating Even and Odd Numbers**:
  - Collected user-inputted integers into an array, then categorized and printed them as either even or odd.

# Lecture 7: Foreach Loop and Sample Exam Application ðŸ“šðŸ’»
----------------------------------------------------
In this lecture, we delved into the `foreach` loop in C# and developed a sample application for managing student exam scores:

### Foreach Loop Basics:
- **Basic Iteration**: 
  - Used a `foreach` loop to iterate through arrays and lists, demonstrating how to access and display each element in collections such as cities and numbers.
  
- **Filtering Even Numbers**: 
  - Implemented a `foreach` loop to identify and print even numbers from a collection of integers.

### Summation of Elements:
- **Total Calculation**:
  - Used a `foreach` loop to calculate the total of an array of numbers by iterating through each element and accumulating their values.

### User Input and Student Management:
- **Collecting Student Data**: 
  - Designed a system to gather information about students, including their names and exam scores, using user input.

### Parameterized Void Methods:
- **Using Parameters**: 
  - Developed methods that accept parameters, such as `WriteMethod()`, which prints a customer's name, and `CustomerCard()`, which outputs a full name. 
  - Implemented the `Subtract()` method to perform subtraction on three integers and display the result.

### Methods that Return a Value:
- **Returning Values**: 
  - Created methods like `CustomerName()` and `StudentCard()` that return specific strings, demonstrating how to use return statements effectively.

### Parameterized Methods that Return a Value:
- **Country Card Example**: 
  - Developed the `CountryCard()` method, which takes country details as parameters and returns a formatted string with information about the country.
  - Collected user input for country details and displayed the results, reinforcing the interaction with user input.

### Additional Functionality:
- **Multiplication Method**: 
  - Created a method named `Multiply()` to multiply two numbers and return the result.

### Exam Application:
- **Calculating Exam Results**: 
  - Built an `ExamResult()` method that evaluates a student's average score from three exams, determining whether the student passed or failed based on their average score and returning a descriptive message.
  - Collected student names and exam scores through user input, integrating all concepts learned into a practical application.

This lecture provided a comprehensive understanding of methods in C#, covering both void and return value methods, parameterized methods, and practical applications of these concepts in developing a simple exam evaluation application.

Hereâ€™s a concise summary for **Lecture 9** that focuses on the ADO.NET concepts demonstrated in your database project:

---

# Lecture 9: ADO.NET and Database Interaction ðŸ“šðŸ’»
----------------------------------------------------
In this lecture, we explored the basics of using ADO.NET for database operations in C#:

### Overview:
- Developed a console application to manage product-category information from a SQL database.

### Key Components:
1. **SqlConnection**: Established a connection to the SQL Server database using a connection string.
2. **SqlCommand**: Used to execute SQL queries. In this case, we retrieved all records from the `TblCategories` table.
3. **SqlDataAdapter**: Facilitated the retrieval of data into a `DataTable`, which acts as an in-memory representation of the data.
4. **DataTable**: Stored the results of the SQL query, allowing iteration over the rows.

### Data Retrieval:
- Closed the connection after executing the command and used nested loops to print the contents of the `DataTable`, displaying each row's data.

This lecture emphasized how to connect to a database and retrieve data efficiently using ADO.NET, laying the groundwork for more complex database interactions.
